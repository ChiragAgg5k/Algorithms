# Algorithms

This is a repository of algorithms implemented in various languages. The algorithms are organized by language and then the different types of algorithms are listed. The algorithms are implemented in a way that they can be easily understood and modified.

## Refereces

There are multiple references that I used to learn the algorithms. The following are the some references that I used:
