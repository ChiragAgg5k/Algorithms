Hello! So basically this folder contains implementation of all the algorithms i have learnt till now. None of these are original and probably stolen by someone , but i have tried to steal the concept not the code and then wrote the code myself. 

Book i am using -> CLRS Introduction to Algorithms

Course i am following -> MIT Opencourseware Introduction to Algorithms (6.006)

It contains:
1) Insertion Sort
2) Merge Sort
3) Binary Search
4) Counting Search
