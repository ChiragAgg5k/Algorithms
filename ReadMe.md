# Algorithms

This repository contains collection of different algorithms implemented in different languages. All the algorithms have are well documented and can be verified by the user through custom test cases.

I studied the very popular book [Introduction to Algorithms](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms) by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein, for learning the theory behind each of these algorithms in depth. I also used sites like [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) for simpler explanations and code references.

Lastly, I followed the free MIT course [MIT 6.006 Introduction to Algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtSuA80QTyo&list=PLUl4u3cNGP61Oq3tWYp6V_F-5jb5L2iHb) on YouTube. It's an excellent course and I highly recommend it.
